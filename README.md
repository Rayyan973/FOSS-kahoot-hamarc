## ðŸ§© Yo whats this all about?

Rahoot is a straightforward and open-source clone of the Kahoot! platform, allowing users to host it on their own server for smaller events.

> **Full Disclaimer:** This repo has been cloned from the Rahoot project by Ralex91. Please refer [here](https://github.com/Ralex91/Rahoot) for the original repo and installation instructions. 

**Changes that we've made:**
1. added custom questions related to recent technologies.
2. demo question feature - first 2 questions will not count for the overall score. Acts as a demo round to make participants familiar with the UI.
